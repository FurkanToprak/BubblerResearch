## Working
* crabevolve.py
* crabtester.py
* crabvisualize.py
* crabreload.py
## Not working
* submit_evolve
* config-crab
## Make
* `archive.sh`. Maybe just attach to normal submission script.
* Make crabtester work with allpop's as well, (give option)
## Test on BioHPC
* Check that `matplotlib.use('agg')` doesn't cause problems.
* Make a script that makes BioHPC the _home_ of all scripts and eliminates need to move files back and forth to laptop.
* See if I can email files.
